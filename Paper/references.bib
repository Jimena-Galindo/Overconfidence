A decision maker assesses a target group by overweighting its representative types, defined as the types that occur more frequently in that group than in a baseline reference group. Stereotypes formed this way contain a ''kernel of truth'': they are rooted in true differences between groups. Because stereotypes focus on differences, they cause belief distortions, particularly when groups are similar. Stereotypes are also context dependent: beliefs about a group depend on the characteristics of the reference group. In line with our predictions, beliefs in the lab about abstract groups and beliefs in the field about political groups are context dependent and distorted in the direction of representative types.

We study learning and information acquisition by a Bayesian agent whose prior belief is misspecified in the sense that it assigns probability 0 to the true state of the world. At each instant, the agent takes an action and observes the corresponding payoff, which is the sum of a fixed but unknown function of the action and an additive error term. We provide a complete characterization of asymptotic actions and beliefs when the agent's subjective state space is a doubleton. A simple example with three actions shows that in a misspecified environment a myopic agent's beliefs converge while a sufficiently patient agent's beliefs do not. This illustrates a novel interaction between misspecification and the agent's subjective discount rate.},

Moving beyond existing results in the literature, we show that the agent's beliefs regarding the fundamental converge under weak conditions. Furthermore, we identify a broad class of situations in which "learning" about the fundamental is self-defeating: it leads the individual systematically away from the correct belief and toward lower performance. Due to his overconfidence, the agent-even if initially correct-becomes too pessimistic about the fundamental. As he adjusts his behavior in response, he lowers outcomes and hence becomes even more pessimistic about the fundamental, perpetuating the misdirected learning. The greater is the loss from choosing a suboptimal action, the further the agent's action ends up from optimal. We partially characterize environments in which self-defeating learning occurs, and show that the decisionmaker learns to take the optimal action if, and in a sense only if, a specific non-identifiability condition is satisfied. In contrast to an overconfident agent, an underconfident agent's misdirected learning is self-limiting and therefore not very harmful. We argue that the decision situations in question are common in economic settings, including delegation, organizational, effort, and public-policy choices.},

A key contribution is that our characterization applies to settings with model heterogeneity and provides conditions for entrenched disagreement. Our characterization can be used to determine whether a representative agent approach is valid in the face of heterogeneity, study how differing levels of bias or unawareness of others' biases impact learning, and explore whether the impact of a bias is sensitive to parametric specification or the source of information. This unified framework synthesizes insights gleaned from previously studied forms of misspecification and provides novel insights in specific applications, as we demonstrate in settings with partisan bias, overreaction, naive learning, and level‐k reasoning.},

The notion of best fit is formalized in terms of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is endogenous and depends on the equilibrium strategy profile. Standard solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and self-confirming equilibrium constitute special cases where players have correctly-specified models.

Each approach has advantages: updating rules transparently capture the underlying bias and are identifiable from belief data; misspecified models are 'complete' and amenable to general analysis. We show that misspecified models can be decomposed into an updating rule and forecast of anticipated future beliefs. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an updating rule and forecast to have a misspecified model representation, show the representation is unique, and construct it. This highlights the belief restrictions implicit in the misspecified model approach.

This paper studies which misspecified models are likely to persist when individuals also entertain alternative models. Consider an agent who uses her model to learn the relationship between action choices and outcomes. The agent exhibits sticky model switching, captured by a threshold rule such that she switches to an alternative model when it is a sufficiently better fit for the data she observes. The main result provides a characterization of whether a model persists based on two key features that are straightforward to derive from the primitives of the learning environment, namely, the model's asymptotic accuracy in predicting the equilibrium pattern of observed outcomes and the 'tightness' of the prior around this equilibrium. I show that misspecified models can be robust in that they persist against a wide range of competing models-including the correct model-despite individuals observing an infinite amount of data. Moreover, simple misspecified models with entrenched priors can be even more robust than correctly specified models. I use this characterization to provide a learning foundation for the persistence of systemic biases in two applications. First, in an effort-choice problem, I show that overconfidence in one's ability is more robust than underconfidence. Second, a simplistic binary view of politics is more robust than the more complex correct view when individuals consume media without fully recognizing the reporting bias.},

   abstract = {Forward-looking agents care about expected future utility flows, and hence have higher current felicity if they are optimistic. This paper studies utility-based biases in beliefs by supposing that beliefs maximize average felicity, optimally balancing this benefit of optimism against the costs of worse decision making. A small optimistic bias in beliefs typically leads to first-order gains in anticipatory utility and only second-order costs in realized outcomes. In a portfolio choice example, investors overestimate their return and exhibit a preference for skewness; in general equilibrium, investors' prior beliefs are endogenously heterogeneous. In a consumption saving example, consumers are both overconfident and overoptimistic. (JEL D1, D8, E21, G11, G12) Modern psychology views human behavior as a complex interaction of cognitive and emotional responses to external stimuli that sometimes results in dysfunctional outcomes. Modern economics takes a relatively simple view of human behavior as governed by unlimited cognitive ability applied to a small number of concrete goals and unencumbered by emotion. The central models of economics allow coherent analysis of behavior and economic policy, but eliminate "dysfunctional" outcomes, and in particular the possibility that individuals might persistently err in attaining their goals. One area in which there is substantial evidence that individuals do consistently err is in the assessment of probabilities. In particular, agents often overestimate the probability of good outcomes , such as their success (Marc Alpert and Howard Raiffa, 1982; Neil D. Weinstein, 1980; and Roger Buehler et al., 1994). We provide a structural model of subjective beliefs in which agents hold incorrect but optimal beliefs. These optimal beliefs differ from objective beliefs in ways that match many of the claims in the psychology literature about "irra-tional" behavior. Further, in the canonical economic models that we study, these beliefs lead to economic behaviors that match observed outcomes that have puzzled the economics literature based on rational behavior and common priors. Our approach has three main elements. First, at any instant people care about current utility flow and expected future utility flows. While it is standard that agents who care about expected future utility plan for the future, forward-looking agents have higher current felicity if they are optimistic about the future.

Abstract: Evidence from social psychology suggests that agents process information about their own ability in a biased manner. This evidence has motivated exciting research in behavioral economics, but also garnered critics who point out that it is potentially consistent with standard Bayesian updating. We implement a direct experimental test. We study a large sample of 656 undergraduate students, tracking the evolution of their beliefs about their own relative performance on an IQ test as they receive noisy feedback from a known data-generating process. Our design lets us repeatedly measure the complete relevant belief distribution incentive-compatibly. We find that subjects (1) place approximately full weight on their priors, but (2) are asymmetric, over-weighting positive feedback relative to negative, and (3) conservative, updating too little in response to both positive and negative signals. These biases are substantially less pronounced in a placebo experiment where ego is not at stake. We also find that (4) a substantial portion of subjects are averse to receiving information about their ability, and that (5) less confident subjects are more likely to be averse. We unify these phenomena by showing that they all arise naturally in a simple model of optimally biased Bayesian information processing.},
